`DVMeshNoise` is an external ITK module for adding
Gaussian noise to an `itk::Mesh` or `itk::QuadEdgeMesh`.
This repository contains a submission to the Insight
Journal introducing `DVMeshNoise`, as well as illustrating
its usefulness using a concrete example.

Repository Contents:

```
# The LaTeX files for the technical report.
./Document/ 
# The most recent version of the module, as of this writing.
./Source/DVMeshNoise/
# The source code to generate the source code for the submission.
# Three targets are built: dv-basic-usage, dv-decimation-error, and dv-wireframe
./Source/example/
```

Notes:

- An up-to-date version of `DVMeshNoise` will be maintained at https://github.com/DVigneault/DVMeshNoise/.

- `dv-basic-usage` generates the meshes used to generate figure 1.
- `dv-decimation-error` generates the meshes used to generate figures 2 and 3, as well as the data used to generate figures 4, 5, and 6.
- `dv-wireframe` is a VTK application used to visualize the meshes.
- `dv-basic-usage` and `dv-decimation-error` expect a directory to exist at `../data/`
